Even if we are not aware of it, most of us seek to be in positions of power because we believe this will enable us to control our life situations. We believe power will get us what we most want: freedom and happiness.

Living our life deeply and with hapiness, having time to care for our loved ones - this is another kind of success, another kind of power. There is only one kind of success that really matters: the success of transforming ourselves, transforming out afflictions, fear and anger. 

Our desire is to embody peace, relieve suffering and help people. We have seen that one person can bring liberation and healing to thousands, even millions of people. 

However, we must first take care of ourselves. To bring happiness to others, we must be happiness. This is why we always train ourselves to first take care of our own bodies and minds. (sağlam kafa sağlam vücutta bulunur)

By focusing on our spiritual power, we can change our bottom line from pure profit to one that includes compassion. We don't need to get rid of profit. Compassion can bring financial and political success. I believe it is simply good business to include in our definition of the bottom line a consideration of all effects we have on one another and on the planet. Business that intelligently combine profit making with integrity and concern for the world have happier employees and more satisfied customers, while making more money.

Most politicians and many businesses from every area, started out with some intention of relieving people's suffering. We have to keep that intention, ambition alive. When financial profit overrides all other motivation, we self-destruct. 

Without compassion, you can't be happy, no matter how rich you are. You become isolated and trapped within your own world, unable to relate to people or understand them. Running after profit at the expense of compassion hurts you as much as it hurts other people. 

At 51, Frederick was killed instantly in a car accident. He never had a chance to retire. He thought he was irreplacable, but it ook his company only three days to fill his position.

If you look back at yourself and see that your aspiraton for success is greater than your wish to love and take care of your loved ones, you know you have begun to follow Frederick. They were rich but not happy.

You are happy when you can relate to other people and other living beings. If not, you feel all alone, in your own world, no one understands you and you understand no one. Love is critical to our happiness.

What most people call power, Buddhists call cravings. The five cravings are: wealth, fame, sex, fancy food and lots of sleep. In Buddhism, there are also five true powers which are foundation of real happiness; faith, diligence, mindfulness, concentration and insight.

# Power of Faith

Faith here is translated as "confidence" and "trust". Zen Patriarch Lin Chi used to say; "You who dont have enough confidence in yourself, you go around seeking these things outside. You need to have confidence that you have the capacity to become a Buddha, the capacity of transformation and healing."

If you have seen the path, if you have a path to go on, you have power. Those who have no path wander around and they suffer. 

# Power of Diligence

You are capable of coming back to your best and highest self, but you must maintain this practice. Don't allow yourself to get distracted and forget to practice. Practice regularly with the help of your friends, family and community. With practice of mindfulness your practice is nourished. This is not to prove anything to yourself. The point is to practice for your well-being. 

In Buddhist psych, consciousness have two layers / levels. The lower layer is called store cons, and the upper layer is called mind consc. Mind concs is normal, waking mind; store is our uncons. mind.

Store cons. is like the land, the ground with many seeds. There are seeds of joy, forgiveness, mindfulness etc. But there are also seeds of anger, hate, despair. All of these are stored in store consc. 

When a seed is watered in our store consc, it manifests as an energy in our mind cons and becomes a mental formation. You have a seed of anger, but when it is asleep and dormant in your store consc, you don't feel angry. However, when the seed is touched, when it is turned on it becomes a mental formation called anger, and you feel the energy of anger rise. 

We all have these seeds and if you live in a negative env, this env. can trigger these seeds. If you live in a positive env, then these seeds are not touched and not watered easily. It is wise for your to choose a good environment that will prevent these neg. seeds from being touched often. You should not allow other people to touch them and you should not allow yourself to water them. 

When you read an article full of violence or watch a violent tv program; you turn on the seed of violence. The first step is not to turn on these neg. seeds and not to allow the env. to turn them on. Diligence here means the practice of selective watering. 

In your daily life, be careful not to give these seeds a chance to manifest. Don't suppress them, just don't give them a chance. Try not to expose yourself to sights and sounds that stimulate the seed of craving or the seed of anger in you. 

So, first aspect is to not giving them a chance.

Second aspect of diligence is calming and replacing neg. seeds that do manifest in your consc. mind. When a neg. seed is triggered, you need to know how to help it stop manifesting and return to its original form as a seed. Don't let it stay too long on the mind consc, because if it stays there it will grow stronger and will cause destruction. There are ways to calm this neg. energy without suppressing or fighting it. You recognize it, you smile to it and you invite something nicer to come up and replace it, you read some inspiring words, listen to good music, go to nature or do walking meditation. 

The first two aspects of diligence concern taking care of neg. seeds, the 3rd and 4th, nourishing positive seeds.

3rd aspect is to always invite good seeds to manifest. You know that you have beautiful seeds (love, peace, joy) in you. Learn ways to touch them and help them manifest. If you live in a good env, where you are supported by a loving and healthy community, you have plenty of opp. to help these +ve seeds manifest. 

Seeds of awakening, understanding and compassion are always in us. The question is how to help these seeds manifest. Read something, say something, watch something that will water the seed of compassion, loving kindness. Organize your life in such a way that good seeds in you are touched several times a day, in your mind cons. 

4th aspect is trying to keep a good mental formation. We have to nourish it and keep it in our mind. If a seed of compassion, a seed of joy or peace is manifesting as a mental formation, it is good for you, keep it there and invite it to stay. The longer it stays, the stronger it becomes. 


# The power of mindfulness

Mindfulness is the energy of being aware of what is happening in the present moment. Mindfulness is the capacity to recognize things as they are. 

If we lose power of mindfulness, we lose everything. We make and spend our money in ways that destroy us and other people. We use our fame in such a way that we destroy ourselves and others. 

Walking and eating are actions we perform every day. But usually when we walk we are not really walking. We are being carried away by our projects and worries. We are not free. When we walk with mindfulness, dwelling in the present moment, no longer pulled by our regrets about the past or our worries concerning the future, we touch the wonders of life and each step nourishes our happiness. 

# The power of concentration

Mindfulness brings the power of conc. When you drink your tea, just drink your tea. Enjoy it. Don't drink your suffering, your despair, your projects. This is very important.

There are things we see but not clearly. We can use the power of conc. to experience a breakthru and see deeply the nature of what is there. 

Conc can help us look deeply into the nature of reality and bring about the kind of insight that can liberate us from suffering. Thru conc. on impermanence, we become aware that everything is constantly changing. We may die tomorrow, we should do everything we can to make our loved ones happy today. With conc on nonself (the reality that we do not have a separate self) we become aware that suffering is there not only in us but also in the other person. Conc on interbeing, we see that if we make them suffer, they will make us suffer in return. 

# The power of insight

Insight is a sword that painlessly cuts thru all kinds of suffering, fear, despair, anger and discrimination. If you are using your powers of conc, insight allows you to fully see what you are concentrating on. 

In our lives, there is misunderstanding, violence, conflict and despair; but these are also impermanent and because of that they can be transformed if we have insight into how to live in the present moment.

However, we stimes forget about impermanence; we forget that our loved ones will get sick and die, we also. We have a tendency to think that we will live forever. For many of us, the pain we feel at the death of a beloved one is not entirely because we miss him, but more because we regret that while our beloved was alive, we didnt have time for him, we didnt care wholeheartedly for him. Maybe we treated them unkindly. When they are gone, we feel guilty. With impermanence we know the truth and therefore we do everything we can to make them happy. Tomorrow may be too late. 

When Buddha talked about impermanence, he was speaking of insight. He was not pessimistic but just reminding us that life is precious and wehave to treasure every moment. With this kind of insight, we don't allow ourselves to be carried away by despair, anger or negativity.

Nonself doesn't mean that you do not exist, it means you are not a completely separate entity. A lot of our suffering is born from the discrimination between self and others and our notion of a separate self. The father and son are not exactly one person, but they are not exactly two different people either. If the son suffers, father suffers. So, getting angry at your son or father is getting angry at yourself. When you are able to touch the nature of no-self, when you no longer see a distinction between you and your son, your anger will vanish. 

When my left arm hurts, I try to take care of it. I massage it and do everything to bring relief to my left arm. I do not get angry at my left arm. When I have a student who suffers, who is difficult, I try to practice like this. I do not get angry at him or her, I try to take care like I take care of my own arm. Because getting angry at my student means getting angry at myself and will not help the situation. 

We need to create the kind of env where mindfulness and concentration become easy. Its like preparing the soil so that the flower we plant can sprout. Insight is the kind of understanding you obtain after youve been mindful. If you allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past and worries about the future, its very hard for insight to grow; and it will be more difficult to know what action to take in the present.

There are many ways to share our guidance, our advice. If we share out of compassion, we will be effective and helpful. We may be unskillful in our guidance, but in the process we will learn how to share in a way that doesn't create suffering, that doesn't turn others away from us. We need to constantly check if we are guiding or teaching for the sake of fame, wealth or a superficial kind of power.

You can evaluate the quality of your authority by looking deeply to see if compassion is the foundation of your leadership. See if your authority comes to you because of your spiritual insight rather than your wealth or your position in the community. 

Suppose you are an employer or a teacher. Because you are in a position of auth, you may be tempted to impose your will on your employees, students. As a parent you know that it can be hard not to use your power as a parent to control your children. But if you do that, you create a lot of suffering. Many people resent their parents because their parents misused their power and autho.

Money and fame are not evil in and of themselves. But if you don't know how to handle them, they become evil. The way you use money, the way you use your fame can leaad you and many other people to suffering. If we are wise and have spiritual power, then money and fame will do no harm. In fact, they may be helpful. It is possible to use money and fame with wisdom to relieve suffering and create happiness. It depends on how we handle them.

Mindfulness;

When you hold the hand of a child, invest one hundred percent of yourself in the act of holding her hand. When you hug your partner, do the same. Forget everything else. Be totally present, totally alive in the act of hugging. This is the opposite of the way we've been trained to lead our lives and run our businesses. We've been taught to do many things at once. Every new tech. promises to help us do more things at once. Now we can send email while listening to music, talking on the phone all with the same device. With your energy that dispersed, where is your power?

Instead of always multitasking, we must teach ourselves to unitask. Mindfulness needs some training. We may be very intelligent, we may understand this right away. But that doesn't mean we can do it. To do it, we have to practice and train ourselves.

Mindfulness is the capacity of being there, fully present. When you love someone, the most precious gift you can gie your loved one is your true presence. 

If you don't know how to take care of your body, how to release the tension in your body and give it permission to rest, you don't love your body. 

There are people who complain they don't have time for a vacation. The purpose of a vacation is to have time to rest, but even when people go onv vacation they don't know how to rest. They may do lots of things and get even tired than before. We have to learn the art of deep relaxation. You lie down and pay attention to and relax the diff. parts of your body. Breathing in, im aware; br out i smile to my eyes. all your body.

When a mother hears her baby crying, she puts aside what shes doing, goes immediately to pick up her baby and holds the baby tenderly. She may not know what is wrong, but holding it already brings relief to the baby. You may not know causes of your suffering, but if you know how to hold that pain with the energy of mindfulness, you immeditaely get relief because the energy of mfulness begins to penetrate the energy of pain, sorrow.



# 5 mindfulness trainings

One time 500 businesspeople come to listen Buddha. Buddha offered them a teaching which was later called : Sutra on the White-Clad Disciple.

Knowing that you are on the right path is the greatest happiness. The greatest happiness is having a job that you like and that expresses your understanding aand compassion. 


1. (bunları yazmıs olmalıyım)





We can be mindful of what we are putting into our body and consciousness. Ask yourself, "What kind of toxing am I putting into my body today? What films am I watching? What book am I reading? " Mindfulness is recognizing these toxins and then putting yourself on a toxin diet. 



So all of us most look deeply into our desire. Whats our true motivation? We know that business is for making money, but we have to understand what goes along with the profit we're making. Are we causing suffering, despair or injustice in the process of making a profit? 

Earning money is just one part of the picture. They way we use money is also important. Money can be used to promote well-being. With money we can buy medicine and save someone's life. We can provide food for the hungry. We can also destroy our own lives and lives of others. 

We may deceive ourselves into thinking that our concern with wealth, power and fame is really only a means for us to be more effective in bringing happiness to others, providing jobs, or helping the environment. But we may be misguided by our pride and sense of responsibility. We shouldn't fool ourselves. We have to be really honest and practice deeply to discover the true nature of our desire and motivation. 

Happiness exists in many forms, but true happiness doesn't come from the four objects of craving: sex, power, fame and health.

Buddha described a dog who, when thrown a bare bone, runs after it and chews on it even though theres no meat on the bone. He doesn't get any nutrition from the bone, yet he hangs on to it and won't let go. Our attitude is just like that. Cravings can never bring satisfaction, yet we keep on running after them.

We crave something because we don't see the true nature of the object of our craving. don't espise money, sex, power and fame: just look deeply to see how running after things like this has brought you a lot of suffering and little satisfaction. These are like saltwater: the more your drink, the thirstier you become. 

It is possible for us to express our love thru sexual intimacy, but we should remember that it must be a real expression of true love, not craving. And second, we should remember that sexual expression is not the only way to express our love.

Right or wrong action can be determined by using the single criterion of suffering or nonsuffering. Whatever causes suffering in the present or the future, for ourselves and people around us, is the wrong thing to do. What brings well-being in the present and the future is the right thing. 

What comes from mindflness, concentration and insight is right; what goes against is wrong. 

This is why, to be happy, we need to take some time each day to sit down, look into ourselves and identify the kind of energy thats motivating us and where it is pushing us. Are we being pushed in the direction of suffering and despair? If so, we must release this intention and find a more wholesome source of energy. 

A bodhisattva is someone who is awake, mindful and motivated by a desire to help others wake up, be mindful and be happy. If you have in you a lot of compassion and insight and awakening, you can act as a bodhisattva in the form of a businessperson, athlete, scientist, politician, etc. The bodh. practices the art of living happily in the here and now and shows up in many guises. You don't have to wear a monks robe. You don't have to achieve enlightenment or have a certain income. You don't have to have achieved anything. You can wear anything and carry bodhisattva's joy, happiness and freedom. And when you have a lot of it, you can share it. 

A bodhisattva may have blocks of fear, suffering and pain withinher, so she returns to herself to recognize these blocks and transform them into compassion, love, understanding and solidity. He has the ability to go back to himself and to take care of his body and consciousness. 

Pain is an inevitable part of life, but happiness is possible. If you try to run away from suffering, you will never have a chance to transform it. Buddha taught that we should look at suffering in terms of nutriments. You have consumed in a way that has brought about suffering. He said "What has come to be - namely ill-being - " if you can look depply into its nature and identify its source of nutriments, you are already on the path of emancipation. "


You have to make time for yourself and be there for yourself. Then you will be able to be there for your family and your company, your friends and community.

Power is good for one thing only: to increase our happiness and the happiness of others. Being peaceful and happy is the most important thing, yet most of the time we suffer, we run after our cravings, and we look to the past or future for happiness.

Of course, our basic material needs for food, water, shelter, clothing, physical safety, and livelihood must be met for us to be happy. Poverty leads to suffering, disease and violence. So here, the desire to have money above and beyond our material needs are talked about.

Later in his life the Buddha did become famous. But this fame couldn't consume and destroy him, this fame only helped his teaching and practice to spread father. This kind of fame was not evil, in fact, it was of great benefit to many living things.

Surprisingly, when you are happy, it is not difficult to earn enough money to live comfortable and simply. It is much easier to make the money you need when you are solid and free. If you are happy, you are more likely to be comfortable in any situation. You are not afraid of anything. 

Suppose you are walking in a desert and you are thirsty. You see an oasis and you know once that you go there, there is a lot of water to drink and you will survive. Although you haven't seen the water yet, you feel hope and excitement, joy; but not happiness yet. Happiness comes only once you actually drink the water and your thirst is quenched. If you don't have peace in yourself, you haven't experienced true happiness.

You can buy conditions for happiness, but you can't buy it. Its like playing tennis. You can't buy the joy of playing tennis at a store but you can buy the ball and racket. To experience the joy of playing, you have to learn and train yourself to play. 

Even after we obtain all the conditions we believe are necessary for our happiness, we remain unsatisfied. So the queston for those of us who want true happiness is, what can we rely on? The answer is simple and profound. Those of us who want to experience great happiness, to awaken the mind of great understanding and love, should not base our mind on any external thing, including form, sound, touch and ideas. We should not rely on anything to give rise to enlightenment or love.

You should not rely on outer forms, business, beauty etc. When you know how to cultivate understanding and compassion in every moment of your life, the outer form of your life doesn't matter anymore. So, the key to success is not the form of a monastic, cop, farmer etc, but your capacity to cultivate happiness, understanding and compassion.

Whenever there is form, perception; there is delusion. We have to be very careful about basing our decisions on the appereance of things, on the outer form. To find happiness, enlightenment and compassion, you have to be free, not fooled by your perceptions. You should look at it deeply and discover its nature. 

Happiness can come to you in a thousand ways if you only allow it to. But if you're committed to only one idea of happiness, you're stuck. Happiness can no longer come to your because youve decided that youll refuse everything except this one path of happiness. 


Buda said; "If at some point in your life you adopt and idea or a perception as the absolute truth, you close the door of your mind. This is the end of seeking the truth. And not only do you no longer seek the truth but even if the truth comes in person and knocks on your door, you refuse to open it. Attachment to views, attachment to ideas, attachment to perceptions are the biggest obstacles to the truth."

We must ask ourselves, "Am I sure?" 
Its like climbing a ladder. When you get to the fourth step, you may think you are on the highest step and can't go higher, so you hold on to the fourth step. But infact there is a fifth step, if you want to get to it, you have to be willing to abandon the fourth step. Ideas and perceptions are like that. You must make room for better ideas and truer perceptions (if there are any).

"
I can't say that Im sure. This is my opinion, based on my best understanding at this time."
"



We may find that ambition - the desire to become someone special - is very strong in us. Achieving and "becoming someone" is seen as significant, yet it can lead us to suffer a lot in spite of our many achievements. How can we deal with the desire to become someone?

Your action, what you do depends on who you are. The quality of your action depends on the quality of your being. 

If a nun is happy, it is not because she has power or fame but because she knows her presence is helping a lot of people. To feel that you are helpful, you are useful to society- this is happiness. 

Teachings of Buddha could be summarized in 4 short sentences;

The bad things, don't do them.
The good things, try to do them.
Try to purify, subdue your own mind.
That is the teaching of all Buddhas.


The Buddha said that all suffering comes from the mind but all happiness also comes from the mind. To purify your mind is to transform your way of perceiving things, to remove wrong perceptions. 

Our minds can be intoxicated by: craving, hate/violence, delusion. To purify you use the energies of, mindfulness, concentration and insight. 

If your mind is full of confusion, anger, and craving, then your mind is not pure, so even if you want to do good things you can't do them, and even if you want to refrain from doing bad things you cannot. 

We have found many ways to save labor, and yet we are much busier than our ancestors were. That is a contradiction. Why? Because we have acquired so much and we are afraid of losing these things,so we have to work hard to keep them. That is why even if you have a lot,you still suffer and become depressed. 


Impermanence means that everything is changing, including the happiness you experience when you are doing walking meditation. Happiness, like all phenomena, is impermanent. It lasts for only one step, if the next step doesn't have mindfulness, concentration and insight, then it will die. However, you know that you are capable of taking a second step that also generates these energies; so you have the power to make happiness last longer.

If happiness can be renewed, so can you, because you in the next moment is a renewal of you in this moment. 

Individual happiness is not possible. Our happiness, existence is dependent on the existence and happiness of everyone and everything else. Interbeing. 

The moment you stop suffering, others benefit.

We are like an ocean wave that believes it is fragile and ugly and that the other waves are more beautiful and powerful. When this wave gets intouch withits true nature, water, it sees that water goes beyond all concepts of beautiful, ugly, high, low etc. Water is beyond all these qualifications. A wave is really only water, and as far as the water is concerned, all waves are equal because all waves are water.

All living beings have the pure, clear, complete nature within themselves. And everyone has to reutnr to herself to be in touch properly with that beautiful, good and true that is within her. 

Often at work, we are afraid of disapproval. We are afraid tobe ourselves, and we change who we are tobe accepted. If you happiness depends entirely on the views of other people, you have no confidence in yourself. Then, when you are not recognized by others as beautiful and worthy, you suffer. This is what makes you want to be someone else, something else, which is the foundation of suffering.

A flower doesn't have this kind of fear. It stands in a garden with many other kinds of flowers, etc. But a flower never imitates another flower. Don't try to be someone else. The cosmos has come together and helped you manifest in this way. You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.
