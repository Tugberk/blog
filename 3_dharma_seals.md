# three dharma seals: impermanence, nonself and nirvana.


1. Impermanence

When we look deeply into impermanence, we see that things change because causes and conditions change. When we look deeply into nonself, we see that the existence of every single thing is possible only because of the existence of everything else. 

From the point of view of time, we say **impermanence** and from the point of view of space, we say **nonself**. Things cannot remain themselves for two consecutive moments, therefore, there is nothing that can be called a permanent **self**. Looking deeply at impermanence, you see nonself. 

Impermanence does not necessarily lead to suffering. Without impermanence, life could not be. We think impermanence makes us suffer. The Buddha gave the example of a dog that was hit by a stone and got angry at the stone. It is not impermanence that makes us suffer. **What makes us suffer is wanting things to be permanent when they are not.**

Impermanence teaches us to respect and value every moment and all the precious things around us and inside of us. When we practice mindfulness of impermanence, we become fresher and more loving. Thanks to impermanence, we can change suffering into joy. 

If we practice the art of mindful living, when things change, we wont have any regrets. We can smile, because we have done our best to enjoy every moment of our life and to make others happy. 

2. Nonself

**Nothing has a separate existence or a separate self. Everything has to be inter-be with everything else.**

When you make cookies, you mix the ingredients and you put each cookie onto a sheet using a spoon. Maybe the cookies think of themselves as separate, but you, the creator know better and you have a lot of compassion for them. You know they are originally all one. However, cookies developed *discriminative perception* and they set up barriers btw themselves. When you put them into the oven, they begin to talk to each other: "get out of my way. i am brown and beautiful you are ugly." We have the tendency to behave this way also, and it causes a lot of suffering. 

**We are like the cookies, thinking we are separate and opposing each other, when actually we are all of the same reality. We are what we perceive.**

When it is said that eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body are empty; it is meant that they can't be themselves alone. They have to inter-be with everything else. Our eyes would not be possible without non-eye elements. That is why he said eyes have no separate existence. 

Nonself means you are made of elements which are not you. Your happiness, in fact your existence, comes from things that are not you. Your mother is happy because you are happy; and you are happy because she is happy. Happiness is not an individual matter. You can't find happiness by running away, because there is nothing you can leave behind; there is nothing you can get rid of. Because store consciousness carries all the seeds. That is why we should practice in a way to understand other people better. 

Things are impermanent and without self. They have to undergo birth and death. But if we touch them very deeply, we touch the ground of being that is free from birth and death, free from permanence and impermanence, self and nonself. 

3. Nirvana

Nirvana is the ground of being, the substance of all that is. A wave does not have to die in order to become water. Water is the substance of the wave, the wave is already water. We are also like that. We carry in us the ground of interbeing, nirvana, the world of no birth and no death. Nirvana is the complete silencing of concepts. (Zen means no point of view) 

The notions of impermanence and nonself were offered by Buddha as instruments of practice, **not as doctrines to worship, fight or die for.** He said: "The Dharma I offer you is only a raft to help you to cross over to the other shore." It is an instrument for crossing over to the shore of well-being. You should not be caught in the Dharma. Impermance and nonself belong to the world of phenomena, like the waves. 

Nirvana is the extinction of all notions. Birth, death, being, nonbeing. In our daily lives, we have to deal with these relative realities. 

We think that being born means from nothing we become something, and from no one we become someone, from nonbeing we become being. We think that to die means we go from something no nothing, from someone to no one.. etc.

When you look at a paper, you think it belongs to the realm of being. There was a time that it came to existence, a moment in the factory when it became a sheet of paper. But before that, was it nothing? Can nothing become something? Before it was recognizable as a paper, it must have been something else - a tree, a branch, sunshine, clouds, earth. Paper was all these things. We are like that also. Before we were born, we were also already in our mother, father, ancestors. 

If I burn this paper, will I reduce it to nonbeing? No, it will just be transformed to smoke, heat and ash. The moment of its so-called dying is actually a moment of continuation. Looking deeply, we see that birth is just a notion and death is a notion. Nothing can be born from nothing. 

We suffer because we are disturbed by existence and nonexistence, death, because we have not understood the true nature of impermanence and nonself. We worry about our own future, but we fail to worry about the future of the other because we think that our happiness has nothing to do with the happiness of the other. This idea of self gives rise to suffering. Nirvana is a fan that helps us extinguish the fire of all our ideas, including permanence and self. Practice is to look deep every day.

A master told his students: "Be diligent in order to attain the state of no birth and no death." One student asked, "Where can we touch the world of no birth and no death?" Master responded; "Right here in the world of birth and death." 
**To touch the water, you have to touch the waves. If you touch birth and death deeply, you touch the world of no birth and no death.**

Impermance, nonself, interdependent co-arising and the middle way are all keys to open the door of reality. No point leaving them in your pockets, you need to use them. These are not fixed ideas, these are teachings we must put into practice. These are not to be hold on to, these are not dogmas. 

Imagine a meeting where everyone is stating his/her own opinions and disagreeging with one another. After the meeting you feel exhausted. You go out in the garden, and you hear birds singing, you feel fresh air, wind is whistling in the trees. Life out here is quite different. However there are still sounds and images, they are just refreshing and healing. Nirvana is not the absence of life. Nirvana is in this very life. It teaches that we are already what we want to become. We don't have to run after anything anymore. We only need to return to ourselves and touch our true nature. 

Buddha says, "My practice is non-action, non-practice, and non-realization". It means that we seek does not lie outside of ourselves. (There is no Buddha outside your heart.)

These Seals are to realize liberation. If you memorize everything but do not apply these during your daily life, it is of no use. Only by using your intelligence and putting these teachings into practice can they bring you happiness. Buddha's teachings are jewels, but we have to dig deep in order to touch them fully. So, please base your practice on your own life and your own experiences, your successes and your failures.
