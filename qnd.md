[SpaceX flies its Starship rocket to 40,000 feet, just misses the landing in explosive finale (2 minute read)](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F12%2F09%2Fspacex-flies-its-starship-rocket-to-40000-feet-just-misses-the-landing-in-explosive-finale%2F/1/010001764c66fd09-21bdf95f-34ca-45bb-8709-d946e08d0f63-000000/4ElFXwGYLh6eQ49rs9gKzmzr6HK14Zz19lvc1YBkJx8=171)


SpaceX's Starship prototype SN8 achieved a major milestone by flying to a height of around 40,000 feet. After reaching its peak, the Starship oriented into a horizontal position to glide back to Earth. Its engines re-ignited as the rocket approached the ground, reorienting itself to a vertical orientation for the descent. The landing was a little rough, resulting in an explosion that engulfed the rocket. Despite this, the test was deemed successful, as the test flight resulted in a ton of valuable data for SpaceX. SpaceX already has two more prototypes ready to go for follow-up tests.


[Tiny water-based robot is powered by light and can walk, move cargo and even dance (2 minute read)](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F12%2F09%2Ftiny-water-based-robot-is-powered-by-light-and-can-walk-move-cargo-and-even-dance%2F/1/010001764c66fd09-21bdf95f-34ca-45bb-8709-d946e08d0f63-000000/7_QR_IRhYGKp36-O3JmLw2EaKrMTVapYxuMRWtmH5aI=171)

Researchers at Northwestern University have created a new robot that looks and behaves like a tiny aquatic animal. It can perform a variety of functions, including moving objects, catalyzing chemical reactions, delivering therapeutics, and more. It is made from a material composed of 90% water, with a nickel skeleton that changes shape in response to light and magnetic fields. When light hits the robot, the material expels water, causing the robot's legs to stiffen. The robots are currently the size of a dime, but future versions will be small enough to operate on a microscopic level. The article contains two short GIFs showing the robots moving about.
